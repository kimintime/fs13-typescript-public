# TypeScript Assignment

- These were challenging assignments. Until I get that bug report, I'm done!

## Create a simple banking application

- I believe I have working solutions at this point, but it's so very easy to miss something. The biggest challenge with this one was trying to see how it all connected. If you're planning a real-world solution, then you go into it with an idea of what's needed and how you want things to connect. In this case, you're following instructions step by step to build these classes that you're not sure how they should know each other, or what they should do, and I'll be the first to admit that makes my eyes go crossed. It's great practice though, and I absolutely had help, happy to have it, so long as it works!

## Fetch E-commerce data

- This problem was impossible without everyone pitching in, but once those major hurdles of reading the api properly were overcome, it all came together swiftly enough!
